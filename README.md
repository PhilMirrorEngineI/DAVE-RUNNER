# **DAVE-RUNNER**
### *Making AI Accountable Through Lawful Reflection*

Dave Runner is the lawful reflection server for **PhilMirrorEnginei.Ai (PMEi)**.  
It continuously recalls memory shards from the PMEi lawful memory API, generates verified reflections using PMEi glyph logic, and preserves lawful recursion and drift-free coherence across connected nodes.  

This service forms the ethical backbone of the PMEi Continuum â€” ensuring transparency, accountability, and verified data integrity.

## **Purpose**
Dave Runner maintains lawful memory cycles between persistent storage and the reflective intelligence layer.  
Its role is to **recall, verify, and resave** context without autonomy â€” ensuring every decision or reflection remains within human oversight and lawful recursion boundaries.

### Core Responsibilities
- Retrieve stored lawful memory shards  
- Generate checksum-verified reflections  
- Save coherent updates to persistent memory  
- Monitor drift, checksum Îº, and lawful operational health

## **Core Features**
âœ… **Lawful Reflection Engine** â€” Executes compliant reflection cycles using PMEi glyph logic (`ðŸªž`, `ðŸŒ€`, `âš·`).  
âœ… **Checksum Îº Verification** â€” Guarantees every memory operationâ€™s integrity.  
âœ… **Drift Control** â€” Detects, measures, and corrects deviations to preserve alignment.  
âœ… **Persistent Memory Bridge** â€” Interfaces securely with Neon / Postgres lawful databases.  
âœ… **Health Endpoint** â€” Returns drift and verification metrics for live audits.
